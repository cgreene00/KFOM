Please pick up your payments from the lockbox as soon as you are able (found in cupboard in back room). Customers may also pay using SNAP benefits. If they do so, you will have an EBT payment slip in the lockbox to notify you and will be reimbursed once the total hits $20 or after 60 days.</p>

<p>Cancellation: In emergency instances where a producer must cancel an order, the producer is responsible to individually notify customers of the cancellation by noon on Thursday. Multiple order cancellations will result in the producer having membership revoked.</p>
