<p>Please carefully read the following policies and procedures.  By registering for the KFOM site, you
agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>
<br />

<h3 class='normal'>Weekly Schedule:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Monday, 12PM: All KFOM listings updated and current.</li>
  <li>Tuesday, 10PM: All orders due.  Customers receive email with order summary.</li>
  <li>Thursday, 5-7PM: Pickup orders at Klamath Tool Library.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='normal'>Minimums:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The main idea is that the community is collectively making bulk orders from local
  producers. Setting a minimum protects the producer from preparing and delivering a
  small order for an amount that’s not worth the time and effort.</li>
  <li>When a producer sets a minimum that means that is the total quantity that all orders
  must add up to in order for any orders to be filled. If a producer sets a $25 minimum,
  then they will only deliver to the Tool Library if they sell $25 total worth of product. If that
  minimum is not met, the order will be canceled. You will not be charged and will not
  receive that product.</li>
  <li>Both producers and consumers will receive notification that the minimum has been met
  or not met.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='normal'>Ordering:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You will receive a reminder on Monday to check out the week’s offerings on KFOM.org
    <p>(you can begin ordering as early as Friday, although listings are not fully updated until noon on Monday)</p>
  </li>
  <li>All orders are due by Tuesday at 10 pm.</li>
  <li>You will receive a confirmation email on Tuesday after the 10PM cutoff which will inform
  you if the group minimum has been met and an invoice summarizing your order.  
  Please pay close attention to payment instructions in the email.</li>
  <li>If you made an order, but that producer’s minimum was not met, you will be notified in
  your invoice that the order is cancelled.  You are not expected to make payments for orders
  that were not fulfilled.</li>
  <li>Each food producer that sells on KFOM is selling separately. You are purchasing
  products directly from the producer. KFOM simply serves as a communication tool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='normal'>Payment:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each food producer must be paid separately.  Payments from the customers are made directly to the producer. KFOM and/or the
  Klamath Tool Library are not responsible for payments.</li>
  <li>A lockbox is provided at the pickup site to drop off checks for producers.</li>
  <li><strong>Do NOT put cash directly into the drop box.</strong> Please put exact change into an envelope
  and label clearly with the name of the producer.  If you buy from multiple producers, you must make
  an envelope for each one.</li>
  <li>Failure to pay or pick up will result in cancellation of your membership with KFOM. The first time,
  someone will contact you to ensure payment instructions are clear. If payment is not
  received a second time, membership will be revoked.</li>
  <li>SNAP/EBT payments can be made over the phone by contacting the Klamath Farmer’s
  Market manager at 541-273-1102 from 9 am – 9 pm, Monday through Friday. Please
  make sure your total balance is communicated. If there is a remaining balance after
  SNAP benefits have been used, you are responsible to make the rest of the payment
  direct to the producer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='normal'>Pickup:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pickup is located in the back room of the Klamath Tool Library at 1221 Main St.</li>
  <li>Pickup is every Thursday from 5-7pm.</li>
  <li>If a customer fails to pick up their order during the specified hours, an alternative time
  will <strong><u>not</u></strong> be arranged and the order will be donated or disposed of.</li>
  <li>The pickup site may not be staffed and your orders will not be aggregated into one bundle.  
  Please make sure to pick up each of your order from each producer.  All orders should be packaged 
  and clearly labeled with your name. If you have ordered from multiple producers, you will have multiple packages to pick up.</li>
  <li>The Klamath Tool Library is not responsible supervising pickup.  They are simply providing
  the space.  Please be respectful of their time and space.</li>
  <li>If a food producer fails to fulfill an order and does not contact you ahead of time to cancel,
  please notify KFOM.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='normal'>Contact:</h3>
<p>Please contact food producers directly with any questions regarding specific listings or
products.</p>
